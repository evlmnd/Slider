##Hey :) This is simple slider app.

### Running development server

First you need to install dependencies. Take into consideration that recommended local Node version for this project
is >=14.x.x.

Run the following command from project's root directory:

`npm i`

After all dependencies are installed run

`npm start`

for running dev server. Your default browser will automatically open the window with running app, but if it didn't you
can navigate to `http://localhost:1234/` manually.

The window will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Running tests

Run the following command from project's root directory for running tests:

`npm test`
